.SH NAME
pgmtogrob8 - convert a portable graymap into an 8-shade GROB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pgmtogrob8
.RI [ pgmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.
Linearly scales each pixel to values between 0-7, with 0 being the brightest
intensity and 7 being the darkest.
Converts these scaled values into a GROB having the original width and
three times the height.
When viewed with an 8-shade GROB viewer, the scaled values represent the
number of times a given pixel is "on" per 7 frame cycle -- giving the illusion
of multiple shades.
